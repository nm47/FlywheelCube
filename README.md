# Flywheel Cube
 A reaction wheel LQR balanced cube using the teensy 3.5

![Build Status][travis-image]


#### Note: This project is a work in progress, the current status can be found under "Roadmap".

## Installation
Simply Download the zip and run, PID/Kalman tuning parameters can be found in the Cube.cpp file.

Note: This project was designed to run on the Teensy3.5. Other versions of the teensy will require slight wiring modifications as the 3.5 is 5v tolerant on most pins and others are not. 

TeensyDuino must be installed to program the teensy through the arduino IDE.
TeensyDuino can be found here:

## Roadmap
#### Todo:

Trajectory prediction on popup, cube must repeatedly pop up within a range of ~15 degrees
Implement PID to control flywheel speed during balancing phase (after popup).
Improve the grip of the rubber corners to reduce the effect of different surfaces on pop-up power.
Improve startup sequence to reduce heat generated by the motor.

#### Complete: 
Read and filter values from the MPU6050.
Account for different battery voltages during initial pop-up stage.
CAD/Electronic design.
Control the H-bridge on the ESC with the teensy.
Build an encoder to detect position and speed of the motor.
